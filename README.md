# Dotfiles - fork of larbs
this is a work in progress fork of larbs for my own private use. Despite this, there is nothing stopping you from taking part or all of my dotfiles.

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- vim/nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
	- mpv (video player)
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
- Bookmarks in text files used by various scripts (like `~/.local/bin/shortcuts`)
	- File bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-files`
	- Directory bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-dirs`

## Install these dotfiles and all dependencies

until I get this finished, the process is a little harder that how luke smith did it

```
git clone https://github.com/GunslingerZach/dotfiles
cp voidrice
sh larbs.sh
```

or clone the repo files directly to your home directory and install the
[dependencies](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS/blob/master/static/progs.csv).
